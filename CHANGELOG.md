# OrbitIQ Changelog

## v7.96 — 2026-06-04 · Competitor Gap = 0 is no longer silent

**Symptom (reported by Wayne):** After the v7.86 uncapped pulls, All Keywords jumped 1,740 → 5,845 but the Competitor Gap card showed 0 with no explanation. Root cause analysis: the jump is the client's own full footprint (uncapped client pull), NOT gap keywords. Gap = 0 was unexplainable because each per-competitor gap pull in `getSemrushSnapshot` was wrapped in `.catch(() => [])` — failures (e.g. Semrush API units exhausted after the large uncapped pulls) produced an empty gap list with no warning. The v7.86 partial-data warning only covered the client pull.

**Changes:**
- `lib/apis/semrush.ts` — `SemrushSnapshot` gains optional `warnings: string[]`. Each competitor gap pull now logs its raw row count and reports: pull failed (with the API error), pull returned 0 rows (likely unit exhaustion), no competitors at all, or rows returned but 100% filtered out (client already ranks / branded / below the gap volume threshold — threshold value included in the message).
- `app/api/analyze/route.ts` — snapshot warnings are appended to the run's warnings array, so they render in the existing amber "Data warning" banner on the project page.

No math, schema, or UI-component changes. Verification: offline harness with stubbed fetch — 4 scenarios (all pulls fail / return 0 rows / all rows filtered / healthy), 9/9 assertions pass; healthy path produces zero warnings and correct competitor attribution. `npx tsc --noEmit`: zero new errors (only pre-existing sandbox-only type-dir noise).

**Action for Wayne:** re-run the analysis — the banner will now state exactly why Competitor Gap is empty (most likely Semrush API unit balance).

## v7.95 — 2026-06-04 · Share of Voice shows the client name

**Request (Wayne):** The SOV legend said the generic word "Client" — it should show the actual client name on both the Executive Summary and Google Ranks panels.

**Changes (`GoogleSerpSection.tsx` SovPanel + both call sites + `page.tsx`):**
- `SovPanel` gains a `clientLabel` prop; the client legend row, the data readout line, and ordering all use it (fallback: snapshot domain, then "Client").
- Executive Summary passes `projectName` (the project's client name, e.g. "Sono Bello"); `projectName` added to its destructured props (it was already in the Props interface and passed by page.tsx).
- Google Ranks: `projectName` prop added to GoogleSerpSection and passed from page.tsx; SovPanel receives `projectName ?? domain`.

Display-only change — no math, API, or schema changes. tsc: zero new errors.

## v7.94 — 2026-06-04 · Fix: Edit Project modal closes when adding a competitor

**Symptom (reported by Wayne):** In Edit Project → Competitors, clicking "+ Add Competitor" and then clicking into the competitor input made the whole modal disappear.

**Root cause (`components/brief/CompetitorsPanel.tsx`):** The panel renders inside EditProjectModal's `<form onSubmit={handleSave}>`. Two HTML/React issues:
1. The "+ Add Competitor" toggle button and each competitor row's delete (×) button had no `type` attribute. An HTML button defaults to `type="submit"`, so clicking "+ Add Competitor" ALSO submitted the modal's form → project saved → `setTimeout(onClose, 800)` closed the modal ~0.8s later — right as the user clicked into the Domain input. (Side effect of the same bug: clicking × on a competitor row also silently saved the project.)
2. The add-competitor `<form>` was nested inside the modal's `<form>` — invalid HTML; its submit events bubble to the modal's save handler.

**Fixes:**
- `type="button"` added to the "+ Add Competitor" toggle and the row-delete buttons.
- Inner `<form>` replaced with a `<div>`; the Add button is now `type="button"` with an `onClick`, and `addCompetitor()` no longer takes a form event.
- Enter key in the Domain/Name inputs is handled manually (`onKeyDown`): prevents the keypress from submitting the modal's form, and triggers Add when the form is complete.

No API, schema, or other component changes. Verified: `npx tsc --noEmit` — zero new errors (only the pre-existing sandbox-only drizzle type noise); grep audit of all `<button>` elements rendered inside the modal's form confirms every one is now explicitly `type="button"` or the intended `type="submit"` Save button.

Note: changelog entries v7.83–v7.93 were tracked in session logs rather than this file; see version history in project memory. v7.94 builds directly on v7.93 (current deployed baseline).

## v7.82 — 2026-06-04 · Merged release (LLM probe v2 + incremental SERP scanning)

Two conversations worked in parallel on 2026-06-04; this release merges both streams and is the one to deploy:
- **LLM Visibility panel v2** (this conversation — see v7.81 entry below for full detail).
- **Incremental SERP feature scanning** (parallel conversation): new `POST /api/projects/[id]/serp-scan` endpoint scans unscanned keywords in batches (default 75, volume-desc, never re-scans = no double SerpAPI credits), merges into the latest analysis snapshot and recomputes all SERP summaries via new `buildSnapshotFromKeywordData()` in serp.ts; KeywordsPanel gains a SERP coverage strip (scanned X of N, progress bar, "Scan next 75" button, live-merge of batch results without reload); fixed Video pill never lighting up (checked 'videos' but serp.ts stores 'video_carousel').

File-level note: the two streams touched disjoint files (probe: llmProbe.ts, synthesize.ts, prompts.ts, analyze/synthesize routes, LLMVisibilitySection, ExecutiveSummarySection, pdf/template.ts · serp: serp.ts, serp-scan route, KeywordsPanel.tsx) — no conflicts. tsc parity vs baseline: zero new errors beyond pre-existing sandbox-only drizzle type noise.

Packaging history: orbitiq-v7.81.zip in the project folder contains ONLY the probe v2 work (the parallel conversation's v7.81 zip was overwritten in a race). Use v7.82.

## v7.81 — 2026-06-04 · LLM Visibility panel v2 (category-driven probe + sentiment)

**Why:** The old probe sent only 3 generic prompts and its single score was inflated by branded prompts. The panel could also render empty when both API calls failed silently.

**Probe engine (`lib/apis/llmProbe.ts` — full rewrite, snapshot source `llm_probe_v2`):**
- Prompts are now generated from the SAME product categories shown on the Keyword Landscape panel (`_categoryBreakdown`, procedure type, "Other" excluded — ALL of them per Wayne's choice).
- Per category: 2 unbranded prompts (best providers / considering this procedure) + 1 branded (pros & cons). Plus 4 brand-level prompts (overview, reputation, top-of-industry, competitor comparison).
- Platforms: Claude (claude-haiku-4-5) + ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini), all calls in a bounded pool (8 concurrent per platform).
- Two scores replace the old single score: **Unbranded visibility** (mentioned when the prompt never named the brand — the real GEO metric; also kept as `overallScore` for backward compat) and **Brand recognition** (LLM showed real knowledge on branded prompts).
- Sentiment: one Claude sonnet classification pass over responses that actually mention the brand → positive/neutral/negative counts + example quotes. Quotes are substring-verified against the raw response; non-verbatim classifier output is rejected and replaced with the detected mention sentence.

**Pipeline (`app/api/analyze/route.ts`, `app/api/synthesize/route.ts`, `lib/claude/synthesize.ts`):**
- Probe moved from Phase 1 (analyze) to Phase 2 (synthesize) because categories don't exist until synthesis. Order: personas ∥ category breakdown → LLM probe → opportunities → narrative ∥ PPT prompt.
- Opportunities + narrative + PPT prompts now consume fresh probe data via new `llmProbeContext()` helper in prompts.ts (handles v2/v1/none).
- Phase 1 carries the previous analysis's probe forward so the panel isn't blank between phases; probe failure in Phase 2 falls back to previous probe data instead of blanking the panel.
- Gap scans still reuse the last probe (no re-probe) per Wayne's choice.

**UI (`components/brief/LLMVisibilitySection.tsx` — rebuilt; `ExecutiveSummarySection.tsx`, `lib/pdf/template.ts` updated):**
- New panel: unbranded visibility + brand recognition + sentiment bar cards; per-category visibility table (monthly demand from real keyword volumes, Claude x/2, ChatGPT x/2, mention-rate bar); verbatim positive/negative excerpt cards; collapsible full prompt/response log; methodology footnote.
- v1 snapshots and empty states still render (legacy views kept).
- Exec summary LLM card reads v2 (unbranded rates per platform); PDF template renders v2 scores, sentiment counts, and top category bars.

**Verification:** offline harness with stubbed Anthropic/OpenAI — 13/13 assertions pass (score math, per-category rates, recognition, verbatim-quote guard). SSR render smoke test of v2/v1/empty panel states passes. `tsc` parity vs v7.79/v7.80 baseline: zero new errors.

**Note:** existing analyses keep their v1 panel; re-run a full analysis to populate the v2 panel. Runtime/cost: ~(3×categories+4)×2 probe calls + 1 classification call per full analysis.

## v7.80 — 2026-06-04 · Keyword Landscape category redesign (separate conversation)

Category discovery now spans the entire keyword footprint (batches of 250, concurrency 5) with a consolidation pass merging alias category names; KeywordsPanel rank-bucket pills + rewritten category section. See version log for details.

## v7.79 and earlier

See the OrbitIQ version log (project memory) for the full history back to v6.0.
